## Overview
**CodeX Clinic** is an AI-powered healthcare platform that offers medical report extraction and summarization using **AWS Textract** and **GPT-2**. The system efficiently extracts, processes, and summarizes medical reports, making it easier for patients to understand their health data without medical expertise.

## Features
### ðŸ”¹ **Medical Report Extraction & Summarization**
- Utilizes **AWS Textract** for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract text from medical reports (PDF, JPG, PNG, BMP).
- Leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to analyze extracted data.
- Summarizes key findings using **GPT-2**, presenting concise and comprehensible summaries.
- Provides **medical insights**, highlighting deficiencies or excess levels of medical parameters.

### ðŸ”¹ **User Dashboard**
- Easy-to-use dashboard for patients and doctors to upload, view, and manage medical reports.
- Displays extracted **abnormal parameters** with recommended actions.

### ðŸ”¹ **Doctor & Patient Interaction**
- Patients can search for doctors using multiple keywords.
- Booking system for **video consultations** and **in-person appointments**.
- Real-time **notifications** for scheduled appointments.
